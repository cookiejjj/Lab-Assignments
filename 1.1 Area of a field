# This program will compute the area of field in acres by entering the length and width in feet of the field in acres. 

# Prompt the user to input the length and width of a farmer's field in feet
length = float(input("Enter the length of the field in feet: "))
width = float(input("Enter the width of the field in feet: "))

# Computation of area of the field
areaInFeet = float(length * width)

# Conversion of area in feet to acres
squareFeetToAcres = 43560
areaInAcres = float(areaInFeet / squareFeetToAcres)


# Display the area and format it that it includes a dollar sign and 2 decimal places
print("The area of the field is $", "{:,.2f}".format(areaInAcres), sep='')
